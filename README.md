# Exercises for Programmers

As an Engineering Manager, I don't have a lot of time at work to code.

All the implementations are solutions to the exercises suggested in this [book](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/), Exercises for Programmers, by [Brian P. Hogan](https://bphogan.com/)
